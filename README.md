# mcda4all

Python library that implements MDCA methods that configure themselves based on the data being analyzed.

mcda4all starts from the view that the decision maker does not know (or still does not know) what he wants, and with the use of the library, he will learn through the results depending on the data under analysis.

mcda4all tries to achieve a preference learning approach based on the data under analysis, which breaks with the classic approach that the decision maker already knows what he wants.
